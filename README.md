# tVNSHRV-metaAnalysis

* The meta-analysis was done according to `Morris (2008)` 
`(https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/analyses:morris2008)`
* This method requires a value for the correlation between pre-post test scores. 
* A value of `0.7` was used as the amount of correlation for each study according to the instructions of the method
* The value of correlation was also set to `0.3`, `0.5`, and `0.9` in order to make sure the results are not affected by the value of correlation
